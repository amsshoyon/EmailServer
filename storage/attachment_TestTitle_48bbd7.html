                                "Website requirements" are the minimum content requirements that the Merchant shall be required to adopt in its website for
                                accepting payments online. Website contents are very important to ensure a satisfactory shopping experience for consumers and to
                                minimize customer complaints, disputes and chargeback. Fulfilment of these requirements will promote benefits for both the
                                customers and merchants alike. The website must:<br>
                                Have an easy to remember domain which can be communicating with customers.<br>
                                * Must host the website in a secure and reputed hosting provider to ensure proper security, specially ensure usage of latest
                                SSL/TLS versions like TLS 1.2 or higher. Major browsers no longer support any version lower than TLS 1.2.<br>
                                * Must include a customer registration page so that customers can register their personal information (such as, name, email address,
                                mobile number, shipping address, etc.) so these can be traced and shown to customers during submission of orders.<br>
                                * Must send an order confirmation email including an electronic invoice to customers after their orders are successfully submitted.<br>
                                * Must include clearly defined data privacy and return policies in the website so that customers can check and be aware of these
                                policies.<br>
                                * Must include SSL certificate (https) in the hosting to take care of security aspects. This also helps in better page ranking in
                                search engines.<br>
                                * Have a responsive design so the website is visible in both Personal Computers and Mobile phones.<br>
                                * Simple and user-friendly journey so its easier for customers to navigate.<br>
                                * Use of compressed images will ensure that the website is loading faster.<br>
                                * Integrating a shopping cart which will allow user to add multiple items while checking out.<br>
                                * Include a section for Frequently Asked Questions so customers can know about ordering and refund processes.<br>
